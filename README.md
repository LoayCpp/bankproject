# Bank Project 🏦

A learning-based banking management system project.

## 📌 Project Description
In this project, I learned how to design and implement a role-based permission system and build a login page that controls user access based on their permissions.

The project focuses on writing clean, well-structured, and understandable code by applying the concept of separation of concerns, where each part of the code has a clear responsibility.

I also worked with external files to store and retrieve data without using a database, which helped me understand file handling and data persistence in a simple way.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Implementing role-based permissions (Authorization)
- Creating a login system
- Writing clean and readable code
- Organizing and structuring code for better maintainability
- Separating responsibilities within the code (Clean Code principles)
- Working with external files for data storage instead of databases

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C++
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
- Data Storage: File-based storage (no database)

## 📚 Purpose
This project was built for learning and practice purposes to improve programming skills, code organization, and understanding real-world application concepts.
